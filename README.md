# Virtual-beer

## Heroku + Python + Flask + SQLite

## [Demo deployed on heroku](https://virtualnipivo.herokuapp.com/)

Since I met my friends we always promise each other to buy a beer for small favors. However nobody really remembers the count.

I decided to try **Flask framework** and implement this as a solution for our long lasting problem. This application using **SQLite**, **Python** and **Flask** is tracking beer count between each pair of friends. This application is deployed using **Heroku**.

Dependencies:  pip3 install --user flask sqlalchemy flask-sqlalchemy

To run the application simply use **python3 virtualbeer.py** . The application is running on localhost:5000.


* Future work:  
  * Simon ows Dita +5 // Dita ows Simon -5. Visualization as a matrix.
  * Registration for each user.
  * Possibility of creating a group for each friends group.
