# Virtual-beer

Since I met my friends we always promise each other to buy a beer for small favors. However nobody really remembers the count.

I decided to try Flask framework and implement this as a solution for our long lasting problem. This application using SQLite, Python and Flask is going to keep track of beer between each pair of friends.

Future work:
  -Update after "+ Beer" click.
  -Registration for each user.
  -Possibility of creating a group for each friends group.
